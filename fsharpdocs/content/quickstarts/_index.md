First create an empty Azure Functions project targetting .NET Core 3.1 and, of course, using F#.

Next add the following NuGet packages:

    FunctionMonkey.FSharp
    FunctionMonkey.Compiler

_Note that at the time of writing you will need to use prerelease packages version 4.0.40-beta.4 or later._
