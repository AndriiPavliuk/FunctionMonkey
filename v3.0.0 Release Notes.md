# v3.0.x

* Service bus functions (input and output) now have Session ID support
* Function options now include a NoCommandHandler method that allows an input to be mapped directly onto an output
* Addition of an ICommandWithNoHandler interface that allows the same to be used by implementing the interface at the command level
* Query parameters now work in conjuntion with a request body. Order of precedence is Body -> Query Param -> Header.
* Resolved issue #62 and added support for enum header bindings
* Fixed an issue with nested types (e.g. an enum declared inside a class, or a class declared inside a class) and header and query param binding
